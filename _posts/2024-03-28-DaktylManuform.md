I'm keen to try out more ergonomic keyboards. In the past ive used standard 102's and TKL's. I have tried the ZSA Moonlander which was alright. Going to build a Daktyl Manuform. going with a 6x6 for the F-row.

**Item List**
using these STL's

Printed parts are printed in rPLA from

KiwiFil on an Ender 3 V2 Neo

right hand print came out well.

Print for the lefthand was not so great.

Right hand with switches fitted.

I have ordered the left hand from PCBWay as a reason print to see what thats like.

**Still to go**
- [] Printing base plates.
- [] Wiring up switches.
- [] Purchasing micro controllers.
- [] Purchasing TRRS jacks and cable.
- [] Installing key switches.
